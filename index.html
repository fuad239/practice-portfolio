        <h3>About Myself</h3>
        <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to
            experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to
            listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the
            music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in
            the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I
            like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like
            to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like
            metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I
            like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the
            nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
